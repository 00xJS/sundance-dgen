# **Project Title: Sundance deGen**

## Project Goal: 
To create a web application that simplifies the creation of event descriptions for Pokémon GO meetups hosted on Niantic's Campfire. The tool aims to be adaptable to various event types and bonuses while incorporating relevant meetup data streamlining the event description process.

## Project Background: 
The repetitive task of manually creating and updating event descriptions for Pokémon GO meetups, often involving significant copy-pasting month after month, motivated the development of Sundance deGen. This tool was conceived to minimize user input and simplify the generation of consistent event descriptions, freeing up time and reducing the potential for errors.

## Adaptability: 
deGen's adaptable design allows for expansion to support various communities by customizing the description output format. Future updates will also ensure compatibility with new event types and bonuses, maintaining its relevance for event organizers.
